# Advanced Databse Management Systems

## Read books, get points!


### Programming language and database server:
1. For mobile application we are going to use Flutter framework, because it is cool framework to make app for both platforms IOS and Android, the code is written in Dart.
2. For backend we are going to use Spring framework with Kotlin language. This framework has big amount of tools and features and it's easy to connect with database and send data to Front with APIs.
3. We are going to use PostgreSQL Database for our project, because it is the best database ever :D
