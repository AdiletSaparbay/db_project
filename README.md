## Read books, get points!

### Project goal and its applications

We know all the knowledge can be found in books. Our goal is to make an app that can awaken the desire of people to read. In our app, users can get points from reading a book, and for top readers there could be prizes.

### Project functions and features:

  4. Authorization
  
Admin:  

  &emsp;5. Upload, Delete, Edit books

### Programming language and database server:
1. For mobile application we are going to use Flutter framework, because it is cool framework to make app for both platforms IOS and Android, the code is written in Dart.
2. For backend we are going to use Spring framework with Kotlin language. This framework has big amount of tools and features and it's easy to connect with database and send data to Front with APIs.
